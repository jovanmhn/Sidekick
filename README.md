A Path of Exile helper that shows item prices using the **official** [Path of Exile Trade API](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade) instead of [poe.trade](http://poe.trade).

If you used [POE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro), it's the same idea.

For now, it can only support some items. The idea is to eventually be able to modify your search on-the-fly and see the results appear.

I'm looking for ideas, so if you want a feature, create an issue!

**Enjoy!**

## Warning
This is a **BETA**, it will probably break in some cases, if it does, don't hesitate to create an issue.
